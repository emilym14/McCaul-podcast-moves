## <u>Moves:</u> An inventory of podcasting elements

### 1. Organization

- *Pattern*

Both of the above podcasts come from the Delightful Doctrine series of podcasts located on the Valley Bible Church [website](http://www.vbcradford.com/delightful-doctrine). Both are structured similarly, having been created and recorded by the same media team, and created to document the same speaker, Bret Johnson. There is an identifiable pattern of organization to both of these particular podcasts; there is a pattern of: opening and introduction, relatable life-example, sound teaching that pulls from the Bible, how this reflects the Gospel, how it can be applied to life, prayer and closing.
