# Common moves in podcastingâ€”

## <u>Podcast genre of choice:</u>

-	*Gospel-Christian*

## <u>Two Podcast Titles:</u>

-	*[The Human Condition by Bret Johnson](http://www.vbcradford.com/delightful-doctrine)*
-	*[The Work of Christ by Bret Johnson](http://www.vbcradford.com/delightful-doctrine)*

## <u>Moves:</u> An inventory of podcasting elements

### 1. Organization

- *Pattern*

Both of the above podcasts come from the Delightful Doctrine series of podcasts located on the Valley Bible Church [website](http://www.vbcradford.com/delightful-doctrine). Both are structured similarly, having been created and recorded by the same media team, and created to document the same speaker, Bret Johnson. There is an identifiable pattern of organization to both of these particular podcasts; there is a pattern of: opening and introduction, relevant/relatable story of an applicable life-example, sound teaching that pulls from the Bible, how the word reflects the Gospel, how it can be applied to the audience's life, prayer and closing.

### 2. Style

- *Sound*

The sound an volume of these recordings are not the best quality, and I believe this can been attributed to poor sound equipment and recording on a lavaliere microphone. When my group and I record our podcast, we will be using the sound-proof recording booth located in Torgerson Hall, provided by Innovation Space, to record our audio and ensure that no outside elements can negatively affect the quality of our initial recording.

- *Additions*

Audible recordings of the audience's responses to Bret Johnson's preachings add an aspect of authenticity and community to the podcasts.

-	*FX*

The sound and visual effects really lacked in both of these podcasts, which I presumed to be attributed to the focus on the root message of the content rather than the overall experience of the podcast as a whole. I think the podcast could really benefit from the addition of a few layers of audio elements to vamp-up the overarching absorption of the podcast. Some specific examples I thought of in relation to these two podcast would be: music, soft instrumentals to enhance mood or draw attention to more significant pieces of information in each sermon, recordings from the pastor's children interacting at home when he references the children in an example at the beginning of the sermon, etc.   

### 3. Narrative types

- *Interview*

There was no interview portion to either of these podcasts.

-	*Narration*

I would classify both of these podcasts as narrations as they both primarily consist of one main speaker over a 1-hour span of time with occasional responses and sounds of audience participation.

-	*Archival material*

The Bible is the only archived material used or referenced in the two podcasts.
