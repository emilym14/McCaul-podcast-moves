# Common moves in podcastingâ€”

## <u>Podcast genre of choice:</u>

-	*Gospel-Christian*

## <u>Two Podcast Titles:</u>

-	*[The Human Condition by Bret Johnson](http://www.vbcradford.com/delightful-doctrine)*
-	*[The Work of Christ by Bret Johnson](http://www.vbcradford.com/delightful-doctrine)*

## <u>Moves:</u> An inventory of podcasting elements

### 1. Organization

- *Pattern*

Both of the above podcasts come from the Delightful Doctrine series of podcasts located on the Valley Bible Church [website](http://www.vbcradford.com/delightful-doctrine).

Both are structured similarly, having been created and recorded by the same media team, and created to document the same speaker, Bret Johnson.

There is an identifiable pattern of organization to both of these particular podcasts; there is a pattern of: opening and introduction, relevant/relatable story of an applicable life-example, sound teachings that pull from the Bible, how the Word reflects the Gospel, how it can be applied to the audience's life, prayer and closing.

The presence of this consistent pattern in both podcasts helps to keep listeners engaged and following along, because they know what to expect or listen for next.

### 2. Style

- *Sound*

The sound and volume of these recordings are not the best quality, and I believe this can been attributed to poor sound equipment and what I can only interpret to be the recording quality that comes from speaking into a lavaliere microphone.

When my group and I record our podcast, we will be using the sound-proof recording booth located in Torgerson Hall, provided by Innovation Space, to record our audio and to ensure that no outside elements can negatively affect the audio quality of our initial recording.

- *Additions*

I really enjoyed what audible recordings I could hear of the audience's responses to Bret Johnson's preachings. I found that those responses added the aspects of authenticity and community to the podcasts, which I found to be enjoyable and overall more relatable.

-	*FX*

The sound and visual effects really lacked in both of these podcasts, which I presumed to be attributed to the focus placed on the root message of the content rather than the overall experience of the podcast as a whole.

I think the podcasts could have really benefited from the addition of a few layers of audio elements to vamp-up the overall absorption of the podcast.

Some specific examples I thought of in relation to these two specific podcasts would be: music, soft instrumentals to enhance mood or draw attention to significant pieces of information within each sermon, recordings from the pastor's children interacting at home when he references them in multiple examples at the beginning of each sermon, etc.   

### 3. Narrative types

- *Interview*

There were no interview portions to either of these podcasts.

-	*Narration*

I would classify both of these podcasts as narrations as they both primarily consist of one man speaking over a 1-hour span of time, coupled with the occasional responses and sounds of audience reactions.

-	*Archival material*

The Bible is the only archived material used or referenced in the two podcasts.
